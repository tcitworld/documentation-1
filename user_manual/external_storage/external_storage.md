Configuring External Storage
============================

The External Storage application allows you to mount external storage
services, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3, SMB/CIFS
fileservers, and FTP servers in Nextcloud. Your Nextcloud server
administrator controls which of these are available to you. Please see
Configuring External Storage (GUI) 
&lt;https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/12/admin\_manual/configuration\_files/
external\_storage\_configuration\_gui.html&gt;\_ in the Nextcloud
Administrator's manual for configuration howtos and examples.

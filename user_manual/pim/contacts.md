Using the Contacts App
======================

The Contacts app is not enabled by default in Nextcloud |version| and
needs to be installed separately from our App Store.

The Nextcloud Contacts app is similar to other mobile contact
applications, but with more functionality. When you first access the
Contacts app, a default address book becomes available.

Adding Contacts
---------------

You can add contacts using one of the following methods:

-   Import contacts using a Variant Call Format (VCF) file
-   Add contacts manually

### Importing Contacts

The fastest way to add contacts is through the use of a Variant Call
Format (VCF) file.

To import contacts using a VCF file:

    gear button.

Adding and Managing Address Books
---------------------------------

Clicking on the settings (gear) button at the bottom of the Apps
Information field provides access to the Contact app settings. This
field shows all available address books, certain options for each
address book, and enables you to create new address books, simply by
specifying an address books name.

The Contacts settings also enables you to share, export and delete
address books. You will also find the CardDAV URLs there. See ../pim/
for more details about syncing your adress books with iOS, macOS,
Thunderbird and other CardDAV clients.

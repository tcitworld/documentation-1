Translation
===========

Nextcloud's translation system is powered by
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/nextcloud/). To start translating
sign up and enter a group. If your community app should be added to
Transifex contact one of the translation teams [in the
forums](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/translations) to set it up for you.

PHP
---

Should it ever be needed to use localized strings on the server-side,
simply inject the L10N service from the ServerContainer into the needed
constructor:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
<?php
namespace OCA\MyApp\AppInfo;

use \OCP\AppFramework\App;

use \OCA\MyApp\Service\AuthorService;


class Application extends App {

    public function __construct(array $urlParams=array()){
        parent::__construct('myapp', $urlParams);

        $container = $this->getContainer();

        /**
         * Controllers
         */
        $container->registerService('AuthorService', function($c) {
            return new AuthorService(
                $c->query('L10N')
            );
        });

        $container->registerService('L10N', function($c) {
            return $c->query('ServerContainer')->getL10N($c->query('AppName'));
        });
    }
}
```

Strings can then be translated in the following way:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
<?php
namespace OCA\MyApp\Service;

use \OCP\IL10N;


class AuthorService {

    private $trans;

    public function __construct(IL10N $trans){
        $this->trans = $trans;
    }

    public function getLanguageCode() {
        return $this->trans->getLanguageCode();
    }

    public sayHello() {
        return $this->trans->t('Hello');
    }

    public function getAuthorName($name) {
        return $this->trans->t('Getting author %s', array($name));
    }

    public function getAuthors($count, $city) {
        return $this->trans->n(
            '%n author is currently in the city %s',  // singular string
            '%n authors are currently in the city %s',  // plural string
            $count,
            array($city)
        );
    }
}
```

Templates
---------

In every template the global variable **\$l** can be used to translate
the strings using its methods **t()** and **n()**:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
<div><?php p($l->t('Showing %s files', $_['count'])); ?></div>

<button><?php p($l->t('Hide')); ?></button>
```

JavaScript
----------

There is a global function **t()** available for translating strings.
The first argument is your app name, the second argument is the string
to translate.

``` {.sourceCode .js}
t('myapp', 'Hello World!');
```

For advanced usage, refer to the source code **core/js/l10n.js**;
**t()** is bind to **OC.L10N.translate()**.

Hints
-----

In case some translation strings may be translated wrongly because they
have multiple meanings, you can add hints which will be shown in the
Transifex web-interface:

``` {.sourceCode .php}
<ul id="translations">
    <li id="add-new">
        <?php
            // TRANSLATORS Will be shown inside a popup and asks the user to add a new file
            p($l->t('Add new file'));
        ?>
    </li>
</ul>
```

Creating your own translatable files
------------------------------------

If Transifex is not the right choice or the app is not accepted for
translation, generate the gettext strings by yourself by creating an
l10n/ directory in the app folder and executing:

    cd /srv/http/nextcloud/apps/myapp/l10n
    perl l10n.pl read myapp

The translation script requires **Locale::PO** and **gettext**,
installable via:

    apt-get install liblocale-po-perl gettext

The above script generates a template that can be used to translate all
strings of an app. This template is located in the folder template/ with
the name myapp.pot. It can be used by your favored translation tool
which then creates a .po file. The .po file needs to be placed in a
folder named like the language code with the app name as filename - for
example l10n/es/myapp.po. After this step the perl script needs to be
invoked to transfer the po file into our own fileformat that is more
easily readable by the server code:

    perl l10n.pl write myapp

Now the following folder structure is available:

    myapp/l10n
    |-- es
    |   |-- myapp.po
    |-- es.js
    |-- es.json
    |-- es.php
    |-- l10n.pl
    |-- templates
        |-- myapp.pot

You then just need the .php, .json and .js files for a working localized
app.

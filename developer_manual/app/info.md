id
--

**Required**: This field contains the internal app name, and has to be
the same as the folder name of the app. This id needs to be unique in
Nextcloud, meaning no other app should have this id.

name
----

**Required**: This is the human-readable name/title of the app that will
be displayed in the app overview page.

description
-----------

**Required**: This contains the description of the app which will be
shown in the app overview page.

version
-------

Contains the version of your app.

licence
-------

**Required**: The licence of the app. This licence must be compatible
with the AGPL and **must not be proprietary**, for instance:

-   AGPL 3 (recommended)
-   MIT

author
------

**Required**: The name of the app author or authors.

namespace
---------

Required if routes.php returns an array. If your app is namespaced like
**\\OCA\\MyApp\\Controller\\PageController** the required namespace
value is **MyApp**. If not given it tries to default to the first letter
upper cased app id, e.g. **myapp** would be tried under **Myapp**

types
-----

Nextcloud allows to specify four kind of `types`. Currently supported
`types`:

-   **prelogin**: apps which need to load on the login page
-   **filesystem**: apps which provide filesystem functionality (e.g.
    files sharing app)
-   **authentication**: apps which provide authentication backends
-   **logging**: apps which implement a logging system
-   **prevent\_group\_restriction**: apps which can not be enabled for
    specific groups (e.g. notifications app).

> **note**
>
> Due to technical reasons apps of any type listed above can not be
> enabled for specific groups only.

website
-------

Link to project web page

repository
----------

bugs
----

Link to the bug tracker

category
--------

Category on the app store. Can be one of the following:

-   auth
-   customization
-   files
-   games
-   integration
-   monitoring
-   multimedia
-   office
-   organization
-   social
-   tools

ocsid
-----

The app's id on the app store, e.g.:
<https://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/QOwnNotes?content=168497>
would have the ocsid **168497**. If given helps users to install and
update the same app from the app store

Dependencies
------------

All tags within the dependencies tag define a set of requirements which
have to be fulfilled in order to operate properly. As soon as one of
these requirements is not met the app cannot be installed.

### php

Defines the minimum and the maximum version of PHP which is required to
run this app.

### database

Each supported database has to be listed in here. Valid values are
sqlite, mysql, pgsql, oci and mssql. In the future it will be possible
to specify versions here as well. In case no database is specified it is
assumed that all databases are supported.

### command

Defines a command line tool to be available. With the attribute 'os' the
required operating system for this tool can be specified. Valid values
for the 'os' attribute are as returned by the PHP function
[php\_uname](http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-uname.php).

### lib

Defines a required PHP extension with required minimum and/or maximum
version. The names for the libraries have to match the result as
returned by the PHP function
[get\_loaded\_extensions](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-loaded-extensions.php).
The explicit version of an extension is read from
[phpversion](http://php.net/manual/de/function.phpversion.php) - with
some exception as to be read up in the [code
base](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/lib/private/App/PlatformRepository.php).

### os

Defines the required target operating system the app can run on. Valid
values are as returned by the PHP function
[php\_uname](http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-uname.php).

### owncloud

**Required**: Defines minimum and maximum versions of the Nextcloud
core. In case undefined the values will be taken from the tag
requiremin\_.

> **note**
>
> Currently this tag is also used to check for the Nextcloud version number.
>
> :   Thereby the following "translation" is made:
>
> -   ownCloud 9.0 matches Nextcloud 9
> -   ownCloud 9.1 matches Nextcloud 10
> -   ownCloud 9.2 matches Nextcloud 11

settings
--------

When your app has admin settings, this is the place to register the
corresponding classes.

### admin-section

In case the app needs to register a new section on the admin settings
page, it needs to implement the OCPSettingsISection interface. The
implementing class needs to be specified here.

### admin

In case the app has its own admin related settings, it needs to
implement the OCPSettingsISettings interface. The implementing class
needs to be specified here.

Deprecated
----------

The following sections are just listed for reference and should not be
used; they are deprecated and often not evaluated anymore (i.e., they
are ignored).

### requiremin

Deprecated in favor of the **&lt;dependencies&gt;** tag.

### public

Used to provide a public interface (requires no login) for the app. The
id is appended to the URL **/index.php/public**. Example with id set to
'calendar':

    /index.php/public/calendar

Also take a look at ../core/externalapi.

### remote

Same as public but requires login. The id is appended to the URL
**/index.php/remote**. Example with id set to 'calendar':

    /index.php/remote/calendar

Also take a look at ../core/externalapi.

### standalone

Can be set to true to indicate that this app is a webapp. This can be
used to tell GNOME Web for instance to treat this like a native
application.

### default\_enable

**Core apps only**: Used to tell Nextcloud to enable them after the
installation.

### shipped

**Core apps only**: Used to tell Nextcloud that the app is in the
standard release.

Please note that if this attribute is set to *FALSE* or not set at all,
every time you disable the application, all the files of the application
itself will be *REMOVED* from the server!
